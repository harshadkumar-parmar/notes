## Jakarta

Jakarta EE was introduced as a continuation and modernization of Java EE, primarily due to several significant reasons:

### 1. **Open Governance and Community-Driven Development**
Java EE was originally developed and maintained by Oracle. To foster a more open and community-driven development process, Oracle transferred the governance of Java EE to the Eclipse Foundation. This transition allowed the broader community to participate in the evolution of the platform.

### 2. **Modernization of the Platform**
Jakarta EE represents a step towards modernizing the enterprise Java platform. The goal is to make the platform more adaptable to current technology trends, such as cloud-native architectures, microservices, and DevOps practices. This modernization helps keep the platform relevant in an ever-evolving tech landscape.

### 3. **Avoiding Trademark Conflicts**
Oracle retained the rights to the "Java" brand, so the rebranding to "Jakarta EE" was necessary to avoid trademark conflicts. The new name ensures a clear distinction from Oracle's Java SE and aligns the platform under the Eclipse Foundation's open governance model.

### 4. **Focus on Innovation**
With the move to the Eclipse Foundation, there is a renewed focus on innovation and the ability to respond more quickly to industry needs. This includes simplifying the platform, improving developer productivity, and embracing modern development practices.

### Key Objectives of Jakarta EE
- **Cloud-Native Readiness:** Adapting the platform for cloud-native application development and deployment.
- **Microservices Support:** Enhancing support for microservices architecture and related patterns.
- **Developer Productivity:** Providing tools and features that improve developer productivity and ease of use.
- **Community Involvement:** Ensuring that the development of the platform is guided by community input and collaboration.

### Conclusion
Jakarta EE was introduced to ensure the continued evolution and relevance of enterprise Java technologies. By moving to an open governance model under the Eclipse Foundation, Jakarta EE benefits from greater community involvement, innovation, and modernization to meet the needs of modern enterprise applications.
